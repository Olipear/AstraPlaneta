# AstraPlaneta
Simple space exploration game

I developed my game in unity, principly it is portfoilo peice, and tech demo. The major element of my game is the procedural solar system generator which I based off 'Star Gen'. I adaptated, and stripped down this library to suit the game's needs. The major part which I added in consisted of several functions to determine a planet's habitablity, which is a core mechanic of my game. I tried to keep the equations as realistic as possible, for example the atmosphere is breatable based on both the pressure and oxygen content. At low pressure high oxygen content can be tolerated, but at higher pressures oxygen becomes toxic. This level of realisim aimed to add educational value to the game.
